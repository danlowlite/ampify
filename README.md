# ampify
A Project to automatically make AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) in PHP. 

This currently represents a method to create them. It is not the most elegant solution, but it works for me and creates valid AMP-HTML based on my input files. Those files only have a small selection of markups. 

# usage
0. Copy ampify.php to directory. Requires PHP 5.5+. 
1. Generate your file (example here is the "stub.php" file). Include relevant PHP stuffs.  
2. Make a copy of the "amp_stub.php" and substitute "stub" with the name of your file.
3. Go.
